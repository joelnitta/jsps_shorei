    A vittarioid fern from the Solomon Islands, which has long been treated as
    Antrophyum semicostatum, is described here as a new species, Antrophyum
    solomonense . A description, illustration, and distribution of the new
    species are presented. Boot-shaped paraphysal apical cells, rounded stipe in
    cross section, and thin rhizome scale cell walls are the diagnostic
    characteristics of A. solomonense. A molecular phylogeny inferred from four
    chloroplast markers further supports its systematic uniqueness.

    Polyphlebium borbonicum is newly recorded in Central and South America and
    Easternmost Polynesia (Marquesas and Society Islands). It has been
    misidentified as P. diaphanum and as P. endlicherianum in the New World and
    in the Pacific, respectively. Polyphlebium borbonicum is distinguishable
    from true P. diaphanum by broader blade segments, and from true P.
    endlicherianum by the absence of a marginal elongate cell row of the lamina.

    BACKGROUND: DNA barcoding is expected to be an effective identification tool
    for organisms with heteromorphic generations such as pteridophytes, which
    possess a morphologically simple gametophyte generation. Although a
    reference data set including complete coverage of the target local
    flora/fauna is necessary for accurate identification, DNA barcode studies
    including such rich taxonomic sampling on a countrywide scale are lacking.
    METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The Japanese pteridophyte flora (733 taxa
    including subspecies and varieties) was used to test the utility of two
    plastid DNA barcode regions (rbcL and trnH-psbA) with the intention of
    developing an identification system for native gametophytes. DNA sequences
    were obtained from each of 689 (94.0%) taxa for rbcL and 617 (84.2%) taxa
    for trnH-psbA. Mean interspecific divergence values across all taxon pairs
    (K2P genetic distances) did not reveal a significant difference in rate
    between trnH-psbA and rbcL, but mean K2P distances of each genus showed
    significant heterogeneity according to systematic position. The minimum fail
    rate of taxon discrimination in an identification test using BLAST (12.52%)
    was obtained when rbcL and trnH-psbA were combined, and became lower in
    datasets excluding infraspecific taxa or apogamous taxa, or including sexual
    diploids only. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrates the overall
    effectiveness of DNA barcodes for species identification in the Japanese
    pteridophyte flora. Although this flora is characterized by a high
    occurrence of apogamous taxa that pose a serious challenge to identification
    using DNA barcodes, such taxa are limited to a small number of genera, and
    only minimally detract from the overall success rate. In the case that a
    query sequence is matched to a known apogamous genus, routine species
    identification may not be possible. Otherwise, DNA barcoding is a practical
    tool for identification of most Japanese pteridophytes, and is especially
    anticipated to be helpful for identification of non-hybridizing
    gametophytes.

    PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Ferns and lycophytes are the only extant land plants
    with two free-living generations (sporophytes and gametophytes); hence, a
    single species may have two different distributions. The distribution of the
    gametophytes of most fern species, which are much smaller in size than
    sporophytes, are almost unknown due to the difficulty of identifying
    gametophytes using morphological characters. METHODS: Twelve quadrats (1
    m(2) or 0.25 m(2)), each subdivided into a grid of 100 (10 × 10) or 25 (5 ×
    5) squares, were used to survey gametophytes in the Japanese Archipelago,
    where distribution data of sporophytes and "DNA barcodes" for identification
    of gametophytes have fully been established in previous studies. Collected
    gametophytes were identified using the plastid rbcL-a region. KEY RESULTS:
    In total, gametophytes of 38 species in two broad morphological categories
    (28 cordiform and 10 noncordiform species) were identified among 407
    collections. The cordiform gametophytes discovered are without exception
    accompanied by their conspecific sporophytes at the periphery of the
    quadrats. On the other hand, the sporophytic counterparts of the
    noncordiform gametophytes are often not found or are rare around the sites.
    CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates with a regional flora that fern
    gametophytes do not always co-occur with sporophytes of the same species. In
    particular, noncordiform gametophytes tended to occur independently of
    conspecific sporophytes. This pattern may be due to the capability for
    indeterminate growth and vegetative reproduction by gemmae in noncordiform
    gametophytes.

    The fern and lycophyte flora of Japan comprising 721 native taxa (including
    subspecies and varieties) plus 371 interspecific hybrids was reassessed
    using a nearly comprehensively sampled distribution map at 10 km resolution
    vouchered by 216,687 specimens, up-to-date cytotaxonomic information
    covering 74% of the taxa, and an rbcL sequence dataset covering 97.9% of the
    taxa. Spatial distribution of species richness and phylogenetic diversity
    was visualized. Apomixis was observed in 11.0% of the native taxa whose
    reproductive modes are known. The number of sexually reproducing polyploid
    taxa (n = 199) is less than sexual diploids (n = 241), and 30 of them are
    evidently allopolyploid, in contrast with the low number of possible
    autopolyploids (n = 4). Apomictic taxa were found to have smaller
    latitudinal ranges than sexual taxa or taxa with multiple reproductive
    modes. A morphological character dataset in Lucid format is provided for
    taxonomic identification of the native taxa.

    Nepenthes is a genus of carnivorous pitcher plants with high intra- and
    interspecific morphological diversity. Many species produce dimorphic
    pitchers, and the relative production rate of the two morphs varies
    interspecifically. Despite their probable ecological importance to the
    plants, little is known about the selective context under which various
    pitcher traits have evolved. This is especially true of colour-related
    traits, which have not been examined in a phylogenetic context. Using field
    observations of one polymorphic species (N. gracilis) and comparative
    phylogenetic analysis of 85 species across the genus, we investigate
    correlations between colour polymorphism and ecological factors including
    altitude, light environment and herbivory. In N. gracilis, colour does not
    correlate with amount of prey captured, but red pitchers experience less
    herbivory. Throughout the genus, colour polymorphism with redder lower
    pitchers appears to be evolutionarily favoured. We found a lack of
    phylogenetic signal for most traits, either suggesting that most traits are
    labile or reflecting the uncertainty regarding the underlying tree topology.
    This study highlights ecological correlates of the vast phenotypic diversity
    of this group of tropical plants. We point to a need for future study
    examining herbivores of Nepenthes and experimental investigations on colour
    polymorphism.

    Understanding spatial patterns of biodiversity is critical for conservation
    planning, particularly given rapid habitat loss and human-induced climatic
    change. Diversity and endemism are typically assessed by comparing species
    ranges across regions. However, investigation of patterns of species
    diversity alone misses out on the full richness of patterns that can be
    inferred using a phylogenetic approach. Here, using Australian Acacia as an
    example, we show that the application of phylogenetic methods, particularly
    two new measures, relative phylogenetic diversity and relative phylogenetic
    endemism, greatly enhances our knowledge of biodiversity across both space
    and time. We found that areas of high species richness and species endemism
    are not necessarily areas of high phylogenetic diversity or phylogenetic
    endemism. We propose a new method called categorical analysis of neo- and
    paleo-endemism (CANAPE) that allows, for the first time, a clear,
    quantitative distinction between centres of neo- and paleo-endemism, useful
    to the conservation decision-making process.

    The Moorea Biocode seeks to compile an integrative taxonomy based on
    morphological, ecological, and molecular data for the entire macrobiota of
    the island of Moorea, French Polynesia. As a case study exploring the
    utility of selected molecular data for species identification within this
    integrative taxonomic framework, chloroplast DNA from three regions (rbcL,
    trnSGG, trnH-psbA) were sequenced for all species of filmy ferns
    (Hymenophyllaceae) known from Moorea. The relative utility of each of these
    regions for the purposes of phylogenetic analysis and DNA-based
    identification was inferred by estimating support for phylogenetic trees
    reconstructed from each region and by calculating intraspecific and
    interspecific distance values (uncorrected p) between taxa for each region.
    All three of these regions were found to be potentially useful for
    phylogenetic studies at the appropriate taxonomic level. trnH-psbA was
    determined to have the greatest utility as a potential marker for DNA-based
    identification because of its high interspecific variability and high degree
    of amplification success. rbcL and trnH-psbA were successfully used in
    combination with morphological characters to identify a previously
    unidentified Moorean filmy fern species, Polyphlebium borbonicum. The
    presented results support trnH-psbA as appropriate for completing the plant
    section of the Moorea Biocode, although the use of additional markers will
    be necessary.

    Hemi-epiphytism represents an evolutionarily important yet poorly understood
    growth habit in ferns. Anatomy and ontogeny related to hemi-epiphytism in
    the fern Vandenboschia collariata (Hymenophyllaceae) were investigated at La
    Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. Multiple specimens representing all
    stages of gametophyte and sporophyte growth were observed in the field,
    collected, and examined in the laboratory. Cross sections of sporophyte
    roots and stems were made by hand, and examined using light microscopy.
    Sporophytes were found to initiate growth on the base of trees up to ca. 25
    cm above the ground. Two types of stems were produced: 1) a short stem that
    produces crowded roots, and 2) one or more climbing stems that branch from
    the short stem, climb up the trunk, and produce distant leaves but no roots.
    This study presents the first description of gametophytes in V. collariata
    and clarifies ontogeny and anatomy related to the hemi-epiphytic growth
    habit in ferns.

    PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Hybridization is an important mechanism of speciation
    in plants and often results in complexes that comprise multiple sexual
    diploids and their hybrid offspring. However, the intricacy of these systems
    has prevented a thorough understanding of many groups. The Crepidomanes
    minutum species complex (Hymenophyllaceae) is a widely distributed,
    morphologically variable fern species complex. Although prior reports of
    apogamy and polyploidy suggest hybridization, it has never been the focus of
    a phylogenetic study. METHODS: Morphology, nuclear (gapCp), and chloroplast
    (rbcL) DNA sequences, cytology, field observation, and spore counts were
    used to infer phylogeny and trace hybrid origins. KEY RESULTS: The C.
    minutum species complex is composed of at least three major clades: the
    African clade, clade 1 (East Asia and the Pacific), and clade 2 (Southeast
    Asia and the South Pacific). Clades 1 and 2 differ strikingly in
    morphological variation (uniform in clade 1 vs. highly variable in clade 2)
    and occurrence of hybrids (rare in clade 1 vs. frequent in clade 2). Apogamy
    and polyploidy were confirmed as likely mechanisms of hybrid stabilization
    in clade 2. Despite the large genetic distance between clades 1 and 2,
    several specimens were observed with gapCp sequences from both; diploid
    genome size and sexual reproduction indicate maintenance of genetic
    diversity via introgression or incomplete lineage sorting, rather than
    ongoing hybridization, in these specimens. CONCLUSIONS: The C. minutum
    species complex is a reticulate network including multiple diploid lineages
    and their stabilized hybrid crosses. Additional sampling focused on
    reproductive mode and ploidy level is needed to delimit diploid species and
    hybrids.

    The ferns and lycophytes of Mo'orea, French Polynesia were surveyed as part
    of the Mo'orea Biocode Project during September 12–13, 2006, September 6–27,
    2008, and August 11–28, 2010, resulting in collection of 42 species that had
    not been previously reported to occur on Mo'orea. Specimen citations,
    previously known distributions, and taxonomic notes (when appropriate) are
    given for each new record. New records include 16 species collected for the
    first time during the Mo'orea Biocode Project, and 26 species collected
    prior to the project but not included in published species lists. This
    brings the total number of known Mo'orean pteridophytes to 132 species.

    Ferns are the only major lineage of vascular plants that have nutritionally
    independent sporophyte (diploid) and gametophyte (haploid) life stages.
    However, the implications of this unique life cycle for fern community
    ecology have rarely been considered. To compare patterns of community
    structure between fern sporophytes and gametophytes, we conducted a survey
    of the ferns of the islands of Moorea and Tahiti (French Polynesia). We
    first constructed a DNA barcode library (plastid rbcL and trnH‐psbA) for the
    two island floras including 145 fern species. We then used these DNA
    barcodes to identify more than 1300 field‐collected gametophytes from 25
    plots spanning an elevational gradient from 200 to 2000 m. We found that
    species richness of fern sporophytes conforms to the well‐known unimodal
    (i.e., mid‐elevation peak) pattern, reaching a maximum at ∼1000–1200 m.
    Moreover, we found that fern sporophyte communities become increasingly
    phylogenetically clustered at high elevations. In contrast, species richness
    of fern gametophytes was consistent across sites, and gametophytes showed no
    correlation of phylogenetic community structure with elevation. Turnover of
    sporophyte and gametophyte communities was closely linked with elevation at
    shallow phylogenetic levels, but not at deeper nodes in the tree. Finally,
    we found several species for which gametophytes had broader ranges than
    sporophytes, including a vittarioid fern with abundant gametophytes but
    extremely rare sporophytes. Our study highlights the importance of including
    diverse life history stages in surveys of community structure, and has
    implications for the possible impacts of climate change on the distribution
    of fern diversity.

    A new hybrid microsoroid fern, Microsorum × tohieaense (Microsorum
    commutatum × Microsorum membranifolium) from Moorea, French Polynesia is
    described based on morphology and molecular phylogenetic analysis.
    Microsorum × tohieaense can be distinguished from other French Polynesian
    Microsorum by the combination of sori that are distributed more or less in a
    single line between the costae and margins, apical pinna wider than lateral
    pinnae, and round rhizome scales with entire margins. Genetic evidence is
    also presented for the first time supporting the hybrid origin of Microsorum
    × maximum (Microsorum grossum × Microsorum punctatum), and possibly
    indicating a hybrid origin for the Hawaiian endemic Microsorum spectrum. The
    implications of hybridization for the taxonomy ofmicrosoroid ferns are
    discussed, and a key to the microsoroid ferns of the Society Islands is
    provided.

    Ferns, with about 12,000 species, are the second most diverse lineage of
    vascular plants after angiosperms. They have been the subject of numerous
    molecular phylogenetic studies, resulting in the publication of trees for
    every major clade and DNA sequences from nearly half of all species. Global
    fern phylogenies have been published periodically, but as molecular
    systematics research continues at a rapid pace, these become quickly
    outdated. Here, we develop a mostly automated, reproducible, open pipeline
    to generate a continuously updated fern tree of life (FTOL) from DNA
    sequence data available in GenBank. Our tailored sampling strategy combines
    whole plastomes (few taxa, many loci) with commonly sequenced plastid
    regions (many taxa, few loci) to obtain a global, species-level fern
    phylogeny with high resolution along the backbone and maximal sampling
    across the tips. We use a curated reference taxonomy to resolve synonyms in
    general compliance with the community-driven Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group I
    classification. The current FTOL includes 5,582 species, an increase of
                  ca.
                  40% relative to the most recently published global fern phylogeny. Using an updated and expanded list of 51 fern fossil constraints, we find estimated ages for most families and deeper clades to be considerably older than earlier studies. FTOL and its accompanying datasets, including the fossil list and taxonomic database, will be updated on a regular basis and are available via a web portal (
                  https://fernphy.github.io
                  ) and R packages, enabling immediate access to the most up-to-date, comprehensively sampled fern phylogeny. FTOL will be useful for anyone studying this important group of plants over a wide range of taxonomic scales, from smaller clades to the entire tree. We anticipate FTOL will be particularly relevant for macroecological studies at regional to global scales and will inform future taxonomic systems with the most recent hypothesis of fern phylogeny.

    Ferns (monilophytes) and lycophytes are unique among land plants in having
    two independent life stages: the gametophyte generation, which is generally
    small, cordiform, and short-lived, senescing after fertilization, and the
    sporophyte generation, which is considered the dominant, long-lived portion
    of the life cycle produced following fertilization. In many species of
    epiphytic ferns, however, the gametophyte generation is capable of sustained
    vegetative growth, and some are able to reproduce asexually via gemmae.
    These two characteristics have increased the independence of these
    gametophytes, so much so that some species never produce sporophytes at all,
    while other species produce sporophytes only in parts of their geographic
    range, a trend we term here the “separation of generations.” Pivotal
    results. Long-lived fern gametophytes have evolved independently in several
    families and can be found around the world. We present a comprehensive
    review of the long-lived fern gametophytes that are able to forgo the
    production of a sporophyte, including accounts of their discovery, taxonomy,
    biology, ecology, and biogeography. We also present several hypotheses
    concerning why these species do not produce sporo- phytes, identify gaps in
    our knowledge about these organisms, and suggest areas of future study.
    Conclusions. While several populations of independent gametophytes have been
    identified and characterized in temperate regions, it is likely that the
    bulk of species with spatially separated generations occur in the tropics,
    where little work has been done. Additionally, virtually no studies have
    been undertaken that attempt to determine the underlying factors inhibiting
    sporophyte production in ferns. As 2017 marks the fiftieth anniversary of
    the first comprehensive study published on independent fern gametophytes, we
    can think of no better time for a review on their biology and an assessment
    of the work that still needs to be done.

    Inherent characteristics of island species make them particularly
    susceptible to anthropogenic changes and need to be assessed to implement
    appropriate conservation strategies. The impacts of climate change are
    increasingly being investigated along elevational gradients since they
    provide natural laboratories to study how species respond to climatic
    variation. Ferns are particularly sensitive to air humidity and temperature
    and are therefore potentially useful as bio-indicators. This study addresses
    the question of whether the distributions of fern species richness and
    abundance have climatic correlates along an elevational gradient on the
    tropical volcanic island of Tahiti (French Polynesia). Analyses were
    conducted on two datasets: island-wide richness was estimated using
    published data on species elevational ranges, and local richness and
    abundance were addressed through a transect survey. Correlations with water
    availability, temperature, area availability, and a randomly-generated
    species richness pattern were investigated. Results showed that both
    diversity and abundance varied in association with climate. Rainfall was
    collinear with diversity in the lower half of the elevational gradient (R2 =
    0.97), while temperature was the most important climatic correlate for
    diversity in the upper half (R2 = 0.98). The number of terrestrial fern
    individuals and epiphytic fern cover were both correlated with temperature
    (R2 = 0.86 and 0.81, respectively). Our results imply that impacts of
    climate change on ferns on Tahiti might include change in diversity and
    abundance, and increased extinction risk due to low overlap between current
    and projected species distributions. Ferns represent important indicator
    organisms that can be used to study species distributional responses to
    climate change in island ecosystems.

    Fern phylogeny inferred from 400 leptosporangiate species and three plastid

  type: article-journal

  abstract: >-
    Ferns are the second-most diverse lineage of vascular plants on Earth, yet
    the best-sampled time-calibrated phylogeny of the group to date includes
    fewer than 5% of global diversity and was published seven years ago. We
    present a time-calibrated phylogeny that includes nearly half of extant fern
    diversity. Our results are evaluated in the context of previous studies and
    the fossil record, and we develop new hypotheses about the radiation of
    leptosporangiate ferns. We used sequence data from six chloroplast regions
    for nearly 4000 species of ferns to generate the most comprehensive
    phylogeny of the group ever published. We calibrate the phylogeny with
    twenty-six fossils and use an array of phylogenetic methods to resolve
    phylogenetic relationships, estimate divergence times, and infer speciation,
    extinction, and net diversification rates. We infer a mid-late Silurian
    origin for ferns (including horsetails) and an early Carboniferous origin
    for leptosporangiate ferns. Most derived fern families appeared in the
    Cretaceous and persisted for millions of years before rapidly diversifying
    in the Cenozoic. We find no evidence of differential rates of
    diversification among terrestrial and epiphytic species. Our findings
    challenge previous hypotheses on the evolutionary history of ferns and
    present a new paradigm for their Cenozoic radiation. We estimate earlier
    divergences for most fern lineages than were reported in previous studies
    and provide evidence of extended persistence of major fern lineages prior to
    rapid diversification in the last fifty million years.

    The Old World fern genus Pyrrosia (Polypodiaceae) offers a rare system in
    ferns to study morphological evolution because almost all species of this
    genus are well studied for their morphology, anatomy, and spore features,
    and various hypotheses have been proposed in terms of the phylogeny and
    evolution in this genus. However, the molecular phylogeny of the genus lags
    behind. The monophyly of the genus has been uncertain and a modern
    phylogenetic study of the genus based on molecular data has been lacking. In
    the present study, DNA sequences of five plastid markers of 220 accessions
    of Polypodiaceae representing two species of Drymoglossum, 14 species of
    Platycerium, 50 species of Pyrrosia, and the only species of Saxiglossum
    (subfamily Platycerioideae), and 12 species of other Polypodiaceae
    representing the remaining four subfamilies are used to infer a phylogeny of
    the genus. Major results and conclusions of this study include: (1) Pyrrosia
    as currently circumscribed is paraphyletic in relation to Platycerium and
    can be divided into two genera: Pyrrosia s.s. and Hovenkampia (gen. nov.),
    with Hovenkampia and Platycerium forming a strongly supported clade sister
    to Pyrrosia s.s.; (2) Subfamily Platycerioideae should contain three genera
    only, Hovenkampia, Platycerium, and Pyrrosia s.s.; (3) Based on the
    molecular phylogeny, macromorphology, anatomical features, and spore
    morphology, four major clades in the genus are identified and three of the
    four are further resolved into four, four, and six subclades, respectively;
    (4) Three species, P. angustissima, P. foveolata, and P. mannii, not
    assigned to any groups by Hovenkamp (1986) because of their unusual
    morphology, each form monospecific clades; (5) Drymoglossum is not
    monophyletic and those species previously assigned to this genus are
    resolved in two different subclades; (6) Saxiglossum is resolved as the
    first lineage in the Niphopsis clade; and (7) The evolution of ten major
    morphological characters in the subfamily is inferred based on the phylogeny
    and various morphological synapomorphies for various clades and subclades
    are identified.
